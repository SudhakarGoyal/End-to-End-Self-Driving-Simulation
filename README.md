# End-to-End-Self-Driving-Simulation
With Udacity's open source simulator available, I tried to implement Nvidia's End to End Self Driving research paper. The implementation of the model is the same as that given in the paper. 

1 normalization layer
5 conv layers
3 fully connected layers 

Further steps
1) Training the network for predicting speed, steering, brake and throttle
2) Try using RNN on the extracted features and compute the steering values
